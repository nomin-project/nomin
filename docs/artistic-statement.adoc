Nomin is not only a piece of software, but also a piece of art.
It is an institutional critique, a collective performance, a socially engaged artwork.

Using Nomin to promote yourself or just play with the institutions and personas of the artworld make you part of this artwork (if you want).
When you write the emails, when you send them, when you get exhibition offer or negative reaction from the gallery or angry curator - you are performing, you are making art which you are right to do.
All the time, from mail to mail, you are a co-author of Nomin's greater utterance about twisted principles of the artworld.
Put it into you portfolio, share it with a friends or just get exhibitions.

Feel free to use the facts above to advocate the moves you make with Nomin - anytime anywhere.
